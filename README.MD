The website developed in this project offers the opportunity to donate unused items to charities suggested by the creators of the app. The main objective of this app is to benefit both sides of the "transaction", i.e. the donor (who can get rid of his unused belongings) and the organisations that can make use of the items that would otherwise end up in the rubbish.

Main features:

1. Possibility to create your own account - the website has a mechanism that allows users to register and log in;
2. Caching of users' data - users are not logged out when the website is refreshed;
3. Own project database - all data submitted by users are sent and rendered from the database. ;
4. Contact forms - users can send data to the database through forms with necessary validation;
5. Full RWD - website is fully accessible for mobile users as it serves as a full desktop application.

Technologies/tools:

- React;
- React Router;
- React Scroll;
- React useForm Hook (form validation);
- Sass;
- Firebase (authentication and database)
